Every year new students are admitted in the various program offered by the 
college. On admission of the students in a program, the Academic Branch generates the 
Enrollment Number to every student. Presently, the college is generating the enrollment 
number manually which sometime results into anomaly.
You are required to write a program for auto generation of the enrollment number to the 
students. 

//format s.no according to alphabetical order -first 3
//       program code                         -next 3
//       year                                 -next 4

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    vector<int> v;
    int s_no;
    cout<<"Enter your serial no : ";
    cin>>s_no;
    v.push_back(s_no);
    int pr;
    cout<<"Enter your branch (it-11; aiml-12) :";
    cin>>pr;
    if(pr==11 || pr==12){
         v.push_back(pr);
         int year;
         cout<<"Enter the year : ";
         cin>>year; 
         v.push_back(year);

         for(int a: v){
             cout << a;
            }
     }else{
        cout<<"error";
            }

    return 0;
}
